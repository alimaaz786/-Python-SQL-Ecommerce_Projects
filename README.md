Project Overview: E-Commerce Sales Analysis of Target's Brazilian Operations
This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of Target's Brazilian operations using SQL and Python. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes detailed information about Target's sales, customer data, and product categories. The primary objective is to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
Key Features:
Data Extraction and Cleaning: SQL was used to query and filter relevant data from the large dataset. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were employed to clean and manipulate the data for analysis.
Sales Trends Analysis: Visualization of cumulative monthly sales, moving averages, and year-over-year growth trends using Matplotlib to understand sales performance over time.
Customer Behavior: Analysis of customer order history, including the calculation of moving averages of order values, to identify purchasing patterns.
Product Performance: Correlation analysis between product prices and the number of times products were purchased, along with a breakdown of revenue contributions by product category.
Visualizations: Various plots, including heatmaps and bar charts, were created to provide a clear and visual representation of the data, helping to draw meaningful conclusions.
This project provides a comprehensive view of Target's Brazilian e-commerce operations, offering insights that could be used for strategic decision-making in marketing, inventory management, and customer relationship management.
